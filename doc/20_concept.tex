In this section the main concept of how the controlling in \GLS{eeros} is working and how it may be optimized or improved.

\section[Overview]{Overview} \label{sec:concept-overview}

As base system, \GLS{ros} is taken into account. With \GLS{ros}, the whole communication between different parts (nodes) of a system, can be handled quite easy.
For this, \GLS{ros} provides topics and services, where nodes can publish and consume messages or subscribe to and provide services.
Every node, which is actually a program, can publish messages in all topics but also request information from every service.
Topics are the main communication interface between the nodes in real-time, whereas services are not.
For example the topic \textit{/joint\_states} is used to publish the state of all the joints of a robot.
A Service on the other hand can be used to request for example the temperature from a motor, which is not really important for maneuver a robot.

\subsection[Gazebo]{Gazebo as a Node} \label{sec:gazebo-node}

\Gls{gazebo} is a physics simulation which works quite well with \GLS{ros}.
To communicate with \GLS{ros} there are mainly two plugins substantial:

\begin{description}
    \item[ibgazebo\_ros\_joint\_state\_publisher] is publishing all joint states to the \GLS{ros}-\Gls{topic} \textit{/joint\_states}.
    \item[libgazebo\_ros\_diff\_drive] can be used to consume messages from a topic (normally \textit{/cmd\_vel}) and apply them to wheels from a robot.
\end{description}

There is a third one which could be used as a motor driver, sadly that one is built on top of ROS-1 and not ported yet to ROS-2.
Therefore the \textit{Gazebo ROS motor plugins}\footnote{Gazebo ROS motor plugins from \url{https://github.com/nilseuropa/gazebo_ros_motors}} cannot be used any more in newer setups.


\subsection[EEROS]{EEROS as a Node} \label{sec:eeros-node}

\GLS{eeros} can be used as a layer between \GLS{ros} and the Hardware as an easy to use Framework for controlling, measuring and communication.
\GLS{eeros} is built based on Blocks, which can be assembled individually based on their functionality.
Each Block is processed regularly, initiated by a central executor, and can react to events and actions.
The Hardware is separated through a \GLS{hal} and is replaceable quite easily.

\subsubsection[EEROS Executor]{The EEROS Executor} \label{sec:eeros-executor}

The heart of each \GLS{eeros} Node is the Executor. All Blocks are registered through a safety-system in it and are processed regularly by it.

The Executor has mainly four different modes it can run in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Normal}] All Messages from a \Gls{topic} are received and stored in a queue. As soon as \GLS{eeros} decides to process the blocks, all (or only the newest) messages are processed.
    \item[\textbf{Sync}] \GLS{eeros} is synchronized with a Subscriber-Topic. The Blocks are processed on every incoming message.
    \item[\textbf{EtherCAT}] \GLS{eeros} is synchronized with an \Gls{ether} stack and will process the blocks as soon as a signal from \Gls{ether} is received. All Messages from any subscribed \gls{topic} are stored in a queue until then.
\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/eeros-executor}
    \caption[\GLS{eeros} Overview]{Visualization of \GLS{eeros}-Executor and the two different modes it will process the Blocks. The upper one shows the three modes where \GLS{eeros} is the in charge, the lower one where a subscription to a topic is in charge and processes each received message directly.}

\end{figure}


\subsection[Simulation time]{Simulation Time} \label{sec:simulation-time}

As already shown in \ref{sec:eeros-node}, when working with \GLS{eeros} we can have different master clocks for processing all the blocks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{System}] \GLS{eeros} is normally the main clock and uses the system time for processing.
    \item[\textbf{ROS-Time}] \GLS{eeros} will use the ROS-Time for the timing.
    \item[\textbf{EtherCAT}] A connected \Gls{ether}-Device defines the timing.
    Actually the time between messages from \Gls{ether} defines the timing.
    \item[\textbf{Topic}] A \GLS{ros}-\Gls{topic} can be used in combination with a subscription to a \gls{topic}.
    This \gls{topic} has to be managed by any other node, for example \Gls{gazebo}.
    Take care of \ref{sec:ros-common-mistakes}
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection[Mistakes]{Common Mistakes with Topics} \label{sec:ros-common-mistakes}

A common tar-pit when working with topics is a subscription to \gls{topic}-A and a publisher to the same \gls{topic}.
In such a setup, the subscriber will immediately receive the new message sent from the publisher, notify the publisher which is sending out a message again.
This will \gls{dos} the whole system.

A Message from a \GLS{ros}-\Gls{topic} has a header with the time it was sent.
But the message has no information about from which \Gls{node} the message is.
Therefore a node should never publish to the same topics as it has subscribed.
